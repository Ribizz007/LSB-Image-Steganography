# LSB-Image-Steganography
LSB Image Steganography: Conceal secret information within image files using Least Significant Bit manipulation. A simple yet powerful tool for covert data embedding in digital images.

Overview: This project implements a simple yet effective Least Significant Bit (LSB) Image Steganography technique. Steganography is the art and science of hiding information within other data, and LSB-based methods involve concealing data within the least significant bits of pixel values in an image.

#Features:

Encoding: Embed secret messages or files into image files using the LSB technique. Decoding: Retrieve hidden messages or files from steganographic images. Support for BMP Images: The implementation works with BMP (Bitmap) image files, a widely used image format. User-friendly Interface: Simple command-line interface for ease of use
